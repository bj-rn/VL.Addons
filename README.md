VL.Addons
[![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/VL.Addons?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Addons)

A place to gather contributions by the vvvv community that:

- don’t get added to the core libraries for _reasons_
- don’t (yet?) merit their own nuget packages
- get lost in the chat or forum otherwise


# Using the library
In order to use this library with VL you have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org. For information on how to use nugets with VL, see [Managing Nugets](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/managing-nugets.html) in the VL documentation. As described there you go to the commandline and then type:

    nuget install VL.Addons
